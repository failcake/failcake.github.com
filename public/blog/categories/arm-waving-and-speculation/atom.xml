    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today one of the old Solaris boxes expired. Well, I say 'box' and 'expired'. I mean '1U
Solaris-X86-what-were-we-thinking machine' and 'fell into maintenance mode while I was eating breakfast'. And, in a
truly extraordinary amount of digression and rambling, when I say 'what were we thinking' I probably mean 'The kit had
actually managed to serve MySQL tolerably reliably for some 1500 days.'</p>

<p>I don't know if you lot remember the uptime wars, but they were medium sized in the late nineties. Rather like Sleeper
or Menswear, but with fewer annoying tunes and rather more waiting around. We learned better as soon as someone equated
long uptimes with being an obvious target for some bollix with a copy of Metasploit.</p>

<p>Anyway. A machine that hadn't been restarted since it was shoved in a rack, that was host to a pile of Solaris zones.
What could possibly have gone wrong with that?</p>

<p>It transpired that one set of binary logs or another had experienced a Jolly Interesting Time and had managed to confuse
the zpool enough that the alleged hypervisor had thrown a strop and gone into maintenance mode. Which, um, <em>okay...</em></p>

<p>Thankfully there are no beard-fondling Solaris types around to tell me that the next move was a Bad Idea, but mucking
out the disks, clearing maintenance mode and restarting the beast looked to be the least-worst option.</p>

<p>That is until we discover that the running network config had never been written back to various bits of /etc and indeed
there were no build notes or valid excuses on either the deceased wiki or the somewhat shiny new one.</p>

<p>There now followed a swearing competition.</p>

<p>I suspect that what happened in 2009 was pretty much like what happened this morning. After the eighth or twelfth reboot, the
people wanting the databases back won over 'I would like to make this network config survive a reboot surely the
combined wit of the Sun/Oracle doc and three dozen assorted blogs and HOWTOs can't all be missing the vital something
or other that we can't spot either...'</p>

<p>It's still an unpleasant trick, though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Title stolen from one of the myriad on the internet more cleverer and witty than wot I am. However, Octopress seems to
have added its own twist, so you'll have to do the rest of the 'joke' yourselves...</em></p>

<p>Years ago, not long after a visit to the Anarchist Bookshop and having become mildly peeved with the names of computers at Previous Employ (The failover pair named after the (in)appropriate Southpark characters, the ones that were funny if you were twelve... Mind, we <em>were</em> all twelve; that was part of the fun. Mind also that our American management decided to call us all 'spanners' because of I don't know what made up terrible morale-boosting exercise. Tip for the MBAs out there - if your entire English team has a fit of the giggles in an 'all hands', you have just said something hysterically inappropriate and they are <em>not</em> going to let on until you have the t-shirts printed), I started naming kit I built after anarchists. I think I got as far as kropotkin and bakunin before the option of voluntary redundancy came up and I followed my political convictions and ran pell-mell towards the Â£MONEY.</p>

<p>The Americans had something of a sense of humour failure (or actually maybe they didn't in retrospect) and started naming machines nasdaq, bourse et al.</p>

<p>Last year, self &amp; Sam(oth) start calling the notion of Devops, 'anarcho-syndicalism in action'.</p>

<p>Actually, I think he found the reference elsewhere, but it totally struck home because a lot of the alleged problems that the modern middle class while male technocratic elite have to put up with (only decent latte halfway across town, nowhere to dry yr bike kit in the office) are best approached with an eye to Solidarity (with other teams. Don't let 'managers' or 'stakeholders' play at divide and conquer), Direct Action (fix those problems yourselves. You know your environment best. 'Management' 'control' is bollocks) and Worker's Self-Management (do not replicate process with code. Optimise it out. Build the environment in which you wish to work. No-one will do it for you.)</p>

<p>And, obviously, this is a debased and pitiful version of a full-on political movement. Which is generally home to misogynistic rape-apologist dickheads it seems. (Who act like the polis at the first sign of trouble because that's the only model of dissent-management they have. There is a policeman inside all of our heads it must be stopped.)</p>

<p>You may imagine my lack of surprise at discovering a tool called 'Serf' which lives at 'serfdom.io'</p>

<p>Again, that could well be irony so sufficiently advanced that it is indistinguishable from reality. However, such
Hayek-followers as I have come across didn't hold with that sort of malarkey.</p>

<p>I guess this sort of thinking fits in well with the sort of sods who talk about being 'disruptive' but actually just want other people to provide free services for which they can charge rent.</p>

<p>There's probably another 'talk' in this, but I think it's the sort of thing better done by the likes of Shanley Kane.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For reasons that will become sadly apparent when these posts are read in the wrong order, I've been engaged in the job of interviewing people who've expressed interest in the notion of coming to work for Future. At least one of those people was keen to point out that they'd been looking at our code on Github and was keen to come along and play with it.</p>

<p>Which was nice.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here's a non-technical thing that's been wandering round my head: brogrammers are more or less exactly what you can
expect in an environment run by old-school Unix admins. Or rather, they emerged as a species in reaction to an
environment which itself was a reaction.</p>

<p>I guess I'd better unpack that and provide some material so people can go TL;DR.</p>

<h4>Brogrammers.</h4>

<p>So (i). Brogrammer. You can go look that up on the internet, because that's what sensible people do. If they come across
a term or statement they're not sure about, they can poke about the internet for a bit, gather information from several
sources and perhaps come to a useful conclusion. It's not, y'know, <em>required</em>, but it's nice when it happens and makes
them look much less like dicks than the sort of people who'll just stand there going 'No! <em>Tell</em> me what you mean!'</p>

<p>I would also ask you to go read this: <a href="http://blog.prettylittlestatemachine.com/blog/2013/02/20/what-your-culture-really-says">what your culture really says</a>, because it crystallised (or
began the process of precipitation or whatever) a lot of what this ramble may or may not be about. I have no particular
axe to grind with that piece because I am a white English bloke  in my mid forties, and if I've been a participant in
any of the scenarios listed I've not had the wit to realise it. It rings true, though. True enough that I suspect the
'if' in that preceding sentence is a 'when'.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>So (ii). Old-school unix admin. There are a set of people out there who have failed to realise that the stories about
the 'Bastard operater from hell' are <em>parody,</em>  and that the Dilbert comics are a stark and existentialist warning from
a parallel universe where everything is terrible. More or less exactly like this one, in fact. Worse, there are a
younger set of people who've found the Usenet groups where the alleged greybeards let off steam by making up stories,
decided they want to be Unix Admins, but have cargo-culted precisely the wrong set of attributes in order for that to
happen. More or less like bad Chaos Magick through a wonky mirror.</p>

<h4>Dickheads.</h4>

<p>The end result of this is that you end up with a class of people who cultivate a surly attitude and firmly hold on to
the idea that they are the only ones in the business who know how to do anything computer-related correctly, and
because of that no-one should be allowed to fiddle with the servers (or the routers, as we have seen before) because
through the magic of circular logic they'll do something stupid and this is why we can't have nice things. However,
since one or other part of the business seems to make money via the act of repeatedly changing the things that are on
the servers, they will huffily and with much tutting allow carefully vetted changes to be made.</p>

<p>This is not to say that vetting changes is a <em>bad thing</em>, it's just that making it hard for people to change things is
not a useful substitute for having tested those changes in the first place.</p>

<p>Trying to work with martyrs like that is about as soul-destroying as trying to work with the sort of change-control
procedure which is merely the same attitude rendered as A Process.</p>

<p>The other thing that happens is that if you treat people like children, they'll act like children. Put in a
pr0n-blocking web-proxy at work and people will work out how to get around it so they can look at pr0n. It's an applied
version of 'Well it doesn't say <em>don't</em> put washing-up liquid in the video-recorder'. The point that no-one with an
interesting and fulfilling job would want to look at pr0n during work hours is lost in sulky justification and 'I'll
show <em>them</em>' rationalisation.</p>

<p>[ Yes I have worked in shops where the NT blokes had topless-totty screensavers. It's, I don't know, not something that
sits well with me. ]</p>

<p>So now you've a set of people cast in the role of children, the old-school unix admin falls into the role of
long-suffering parent: "This server won't manage itself", "Don't leave your logs there", "I'll just clean up /tmp
myself, shall I?"</p>

<p>For anyone still reading, that is <em>massively</em> dysfunctional.</p>

<p>As an aside, a behaviour pattern that I have noticed <em>a lot</em> is one where J. Random Dev will ask the admin(s) for
something-or-other (Shiny new webscale tech as mentioned on Hacker News perhaps) and will be told that no they can't
have that because no-one knows how to support it and had they thought about this other tech that looks a bit more
scalable? At this point J R Dev strops off to their Project Manager and explains that must have (shiny new webscale
tech) and that the admins were mean and said no. So the PM soon heaves to in the admin's cube and starts on about
business-critical functionality and unacceptable delays and if you recognise that as 'If your mum says no, go ask your
dad' then you win a rather grubby and worn Internets.</p>

<h4>What is to be done?</h4>

<p>Recognising what's going on is a really good start. I'm bound to say that the notion of DevOps culture is as good a
countermeasure as I have found so far. Other than that, patches welcome. I'm not convinced it's a solvable problem
without a reasonable cultural shift, and given the state of your organisation you may well not have that opportunity.</p>
