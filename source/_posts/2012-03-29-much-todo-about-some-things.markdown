In the wake of Puppetcamp Edinburgh, which was jolly nice, I emitted about half a screen of rambling on one of the work IRC channels as a set of notes for future selves
(pun very much intended). This is something I do rather a lot, because _obviously_ it's impossible to perform any sort of useful thinking in an open-plan office
filled with cheery sorts who Want Things Now. The drive/ride home is also a time for sudden and Hoffman-like inspirations.

Anyway.

Whatever I wrote has vanished off the end of the scrollback, so I'll have to make it all up again.
