Hello. Where on earth did the last few months go? I guess I could blame it having been
Grand Tour season (the Giro, the Tour and now the Vuelta) which has meant that I've been
watching sweaty men in lycra pedal up the sides of mountains for three weeks at a time.

I guess I can also blame one of those periods when several mildly concerning things
happen in rapid order like a conspiring mob of buses, and when the smoke clears you're
somewhere grim like Burnt Oak, Oldland Common or Quedgeley.

Anyway. Let's see what happens next.
