For reasons that seemed jolly sensible at the time (ie - someone dared me to do it) I gave
a much-modified version of The Puppetcamp Talk at [EMFcamp](https://www.emfcamp.org/). Modified in that it was four
months later and we'd made some things work better, abandoned others and had some mostly-bright 
ideas for new stuff.

Thus linked here somewhere should be [the PDF version of the slides](/downloads/emfcamp.pdf), which because I am that sort of 
forward-thinking sod (actually, I'd seen this be a requirement at 28c3, and it seemed sensible, so...)
was the version I presented because the Nice People didn't have the relevent podule to connect a Macbook
to the big screen in the tent.
