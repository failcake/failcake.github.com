  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230; And then everbody left.</p>

<p>I could write a thing about burnout, but I was too fried to notice when it happened. The interesting/exciting/disturbing
thing about being properly stressed is that becomes entirely normal and you only realise something is broken when the
music stops. Then all the things in your head that you&#8217;ve been ignoring pitch up at once and are like &#8216;HELLO&#8217; and waving
cartoon cricket-bats with nails and broken glass embedded.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am incompetent and I can&#8217;t make Vagrant work.</p>

<p>At least, that&#8217;s the excuse I&#8217;ve been making for not joining in with the
rest of the floor in using that for Puppet (among other things) development. Instead, my dev-rig is a VM running as a
puppetmaster that&#8217;s tracking the changes I make to a given branch in our Git repo via the magic of post-commit hooks and
another VM in which I can run &#8216;puppet agent &#8211;debug &#8211;blah &#8211;server (first VM)&#8217;. Once in a while I remember to blow away
the second VM so I can make sure everything builds in the right order. However, even with snapshots it&#8217;s just slightly
too painful to happen regularly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, quite a lot of the recent developments at Future have involved rigs of between eight and twelve boxes.
Generating a worthwhile test/dev version of one of those is rather tiresome because even if you&#8217;ve got the spare
horsepower lying about, you have to spend yea-long wiring it all together, sanitising the static and/or test data and
it all quickly gets completely <em>oh god why did i even get out of bed i should have been a farmer like my dad mind you if
i had done that i&#8217;d have been out of bed at six to go feed the sheep on long barrow bank perhaps not after all&#8230;</em></p>

<p>So when a mildly broken Dell R620 arrived back from one of the DCs coincidentally with me wanting to have a play with
this Docker business, it all seemed a bit convenient.</p>

<p>I am incompetent and I can&#8217;t make Docker work. On Debian.</p>

<p><a href="http://linuxcontainers.org/">LXC</a>, on the other hand, was slightly simpler than falling off a log.</p>

<p>Given that it&#8217;s simple to build a puppetmaster that&#8217;s the same as one of the live ones, and that all the machine config
I currently care about is in a manifest, it should be pretty easy to generate a container and have it puppet itself up
tolerably quickly.</p>

<p>This indeed turned out to be the case. However, having to hand-allocate IP addresses and fiddle about with container
naming such that they picked up the configs in use on the live rig was all a bit too hands-on and really not what I
wanted.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">DNSMasq</a> fixed the first problem. It is a surprisingly useful tool.</p>

<p>A rakefile which read a list of made-up machine names, generated softlinks to the actual hiera node configs and then
instantiated the relevant containers fixed the second.</p>

<p>I also spent <em>quite some time</em> building a Wheezy &#8216;image&#8217; that minimised apt-get as much as possible.</p>

<p>Result - fully puppeted containers come up in circa a minute. Somewhat longer if you have to install PHP.
If I didn&#8217;t have quite such a rational hatred of golden images and all who sail in them, it would likely be faster
still.</p>

<p>The next part is a bit fiddly.</p>

<p>The example problem I now have is that some parts of my collection of yea-many VMs want to connect to other parts. For
instance if I have a redis slave, I need to know what the master&#8217;s IP address might be during the puppet run. At Future,
we generate a location fact and use that in our hiera, er, hierarchy to configure things like message brokers,
smarthosts and DNS ordering. I could just add yet another location - testbox, or something - allocate a block of IP
space and then add some extra indirection. And then I could do that again for each person and/or project that wanted to
run up a test-rig. At which point one has just run into a behaviour pattern that should probably be named &#8216;It&#8217;s OK, I
can fix that for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>I first came across this in, er, 1991 when doing some NHS-related coding. One of the other chaps had written a thing
which had to deal with, oh I don&#8217;t know, ten items or something. Because he was a forward-thinking sort, he allocated
sixteen slots in his array and beetled off all smug for a coffee and a corned beef sandwich. As you might expect, a few
months later one site or other had a list of seventeen items and a bug report. &#8216;It&#8217;s OK, I can fix that for you!&#8217; went
our chap and expanded the array to the clearly ludicrous value of some twenty-three slots&#8230;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s scope for an Eric Berne knockoff book of tiresome technical behaviour antipatterns, isn&#8217;t there?</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m using DHCP, and I wanted the entire edifice to work with little or no extra typing.</p>

<p>CoreOS&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">ETCD</a> looked like a good fit. Emit salient facts to etcd database when bringing up (say) redis master, then
query same via <a href="https://github.com/garethr/hiera-etcd">Garethr&#8217;s hiera-etcd</a> when bringing up the slave. Profit!</p>

<p>That bit did take a little tinkering to get right.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the notion of a reactive puppet configuration is really rather interesting. Other people may well be
screaming in terror and jabbering about things like &#8216;deadly embrace&#8217; and &#8216;terrible feedback loops are fine for the Jesus
and Mary Chain (Or A Place to Bury Strangers if that&#8217;s too retro for you) but have no place in a theoretically stable
configuration.&#8217; However, just as a top-down decision process enforced by rigid hierarchy is a hateful idea for a
workplace environment, so it is for a machine environment.</p>

<p>TL;DR - code in <a href="https://github.com/FuturePublishing/model-village">Github</a>, patches welcome.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today one of the old Solaris boxes expired. Well, I say &#8216;box&#8217; and &#8216;expired&#8217;. I mean &#8216;1U
Solaris-X86-what-were-we-thinking machine&#8217; and &#8216;fell into maintenance mode while I was eating breakfast&#8217;. And, in a
truly extraordinary amount of digression and rambling, when I say &#8216;what were we thinking&#8217; I probably mean &#8216;The kit had
actually managed to serve MySQL tolerably reliably for some 1500 days.&#8217;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if you lot remember the uptime wars, but they were medium sized in the late nineties. Rather like Sleeper
or Menswear, but with fewer annoying tunes and rather more waiting around. We learned better as soon as someone equated
long uptimes with being an obvious target for some bollix with a copy of Metasploit.</p>

<p>Anyway. A machine that hadn&#8217;t been restarted since it was shoved in a rack, that was host to a pile of Solaris zones.
What could possibly have gone wrong with that?</p>

<p>It transpired that one set of binary logs or another had experienced a Jolly Interesting Time and had managed to confuse
the zpool enough that the alleged hypervisor had thrown a strop and gone into maintenance mode. Which, um, <em>okay&#8230;</em></p>

<p>Thankfully there are no beard-fondling Solaris types around to tell me that the next move was a Bad Idea, but mucking
out the disks, clearing maintenance mode and restarting the beast looked to be the least-worst option.</p>

<p>That is until we discover that the running network config had never been written back to various bits of /etc and indeed
there were no build notes or valid excuses on either the deceased wiki or the somewhat shiny new one.</p>

<p>There now followed a swearing competition.</p>

<p>I suspect that what happened in 2009 was pretty much like what happened this morning. After the eighth or twelfth reboot, the
people wanting the databases back won over &#8216;I would like to make this network config survive a reboot surely the
combined wit of the Sun/Oracle doc and three dozen assorted blogs and HOWTOs can&#8217;t all be missing the vital something
or other that we can&#8217;t spot either&#8230;&#8217;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s still an unpleasant trick, though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Trigger warning: contains talk of horrible old Unix kit running horrible old Unix</em></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a good chance I&#8217;m probably a massive arsehole and I get paid for it. Which, I dunno, maybe I&#8217;m supposed to be
pleased with myself about it because being <em>disruptive</em> is seen as a good thing these days. The last time I came across
people being described as such, they were the hyperactive (or just sugared-up) kids at junior school who seemed to be
convinced that it was all about them and if it wasn&#8217;t they&#8217;d throw a massive strop and wander round with a lower lip
hung out like a soup-plate. I&#8217;m assuming a <em>disruptive technology</em> doesn&#8217;t have a howling fit in the middle of the
organic vegetable section of the supermarket if it doesn&#8217;t get its own way, but then I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it did.</p>

<p>The thing about the arseholedom isn&#8217;t malevolent in the slightest, it&#8217;s more a case of going up to someone and asking
them why they&#8217;re nailing their legs to the table. You get this very weird selection of looks when you do things like
that. As if they&#8217;re expecting you to come up with something sarcastic about using the contact adhesive on the shelf.
Then they&#8217;ll say something like &#8216;Well we&#8217;ve <em>always</em> nailed our legs to the table in this department because it keeps
the bees from flying to Winchcombe.&#8217; Which, um, <em>okay&#8230;</em></p>

<p>I mean, there&#8217;s no answer to that. Especially when some manager piles out of the end office going &#8220;D&#8217;you want the bees
to go to Winchcombe? Do you? Because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen if you don&#8217;t buck your ideas up and crack on with
that hammering.&#8221;</p>

<p>But you have to try. You point to one of the chairs in the corner and suggest that using those would be much less
unpleasant. That&#8217;s when the trouble <em>really</em> starts. The manager goes pop-eyed and kicks off about &#8216;You smart buggers in
IT think you know everything coming down here with your <em>ideas</em> I don&#8217;t have time for <em>ideas</em> there&#8217;s barely enough time
to send Bob here down to the hardware shop for more nails, what with the bleeding and the Tetanus jabs and now you want
us to cross-train to <em>chairs</em> I&#8217;m glad you think we all sit around with glue-guns like you wasters someone should sort
you lot out once and for all.&#8217;</p>

<p>So you pull a chair over and they look at you like you just shat out a railway station.</p>

<p>What this is really about is that years ago (HP-UX 10.20 ago, in fact) I was given a HP9000 to look after. In poking
around the filesystem to see what dreadful sort of albatross I&#8217;d been handed, I found a whole pile of cron-jobs that ran
scripts to monitor sendmail and some more scripts that re-started sendmail and further scripts that tested the state of
earlier scripts. It all seemed a bit pointless because even then sendmail could more or less be left alone to generate
remote root exploits and sometimes deliver mail.</p>

<p>I asked one of the longer-serving chaps and he came over all leg-nailing. Apparently it wasn&#8217;t to be touched because
sendmail was dreadfully unreliable and crashed every half hour.</p>

<p>I nodded, smiled and went off to throw away all the junk and upgrade the sendmail install to $latest.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t crash.</p>

<p>The point being that writing long-lived daemon processes is really very well known science and instead of mucking about
with multiple layers of monitoring and backup, you&#8217;re much better off making the daemon work right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Title stolen from one of the myriad on the internet more cleverer and witty than wot I am. However, Octopress seems to
have added its own twist, so you&#8217;ll have to do the rest of the &#8216;joke&#8217; yourselves&#8230;</em></p>

<p>Years ago, not long after a visit to the Anarchist Bookshop and having become mildly peeved with the names of computers at Previous Employ (The failover pair named after the (in)appropriate Southpark characters, the ones that were funny if you were twelve&#8230; Mind, we <em>were</em> all twelve; that was part of the fun. Mind also that our American management decided to call us all &#8216;spanners&#8217; because of I don&#8217;t know what made up terrible morale-boosting exercise. Tip for the MBAs out there - if your entire English team has a fit of the giggles in an &#8216;all hands&#8217;, you have just said something hysterically inappropriate and they are <em>not</em> going to let on until you have the t-shirts printed), I started naming kit I built after anarchists. I think I got as far as kropotkin and bakunin before the option of voluntary redundancy came up and I followed my political convictions and ran pell-mell towards the £MONEY.</p>

<p>The Americans had something of a sense of humour failure (or actually maybe they didn&#8217;t in retrospect) and started naming machines nasdaq, bourse et al.</p>

<p>Last year, self &amp; Sam(oth) start calling the notion of Devops, &#8216;anarcho-syndicalism in action&#8217;.</p>

<p>Actually, I think he found the reference elsewhere, but it totally struck home because a lot of the alleged problems that the modern middle class while male technocratic elite have to put up with (only decent latte halfway across town, nowhere to dry yr bike kit in the office) are best approached with an eye to Solidarity (with other teams. Don&#8217;t let &#8216;managers&#8217; or &#8216;stakeholders&#8217; play at divide and conquer), Direct Action (fix those problems yourselves. You know your environment best. &#8216;Management&#8217; &#8216;control&#8217; is bollocks) and Worker&#8217;s Self-Management (do not replicate process with code. Optimise it out. Build the environment in which you wish to work. No-one will do it for you.)</p>

<p>And, obviously, this is a debased and pitiful version of a full-on political movement. Which is generally home to misogynistic rape-apologist dickheads it seems. (Who act like the polis at the first sign of trouble because that&#8217;s the only model of dissent-management they have. There is a policeman inside all of our heads it must be stopped.)</p>

<p>You may imagine my lack of surprise at discovering a tool called &#8216;Serf&#8217; which lives at &#8216;serfdom.io&#8217;</p>

<p>Again, that could well be irony so sufficiently advanced that it is indistinguishable from reality. However, such
Hayek-followers as I have come across didn&#8217;t hold with that sort of malarkey.</p>

<p>I guess this sort of thinking fits in well with the sort of sods who talk about being &#8216;disruptive&#8217; but actually just want other people to provide free services for which they can charge rent.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s probably another &#8216;talk&#8217; in this, but I think it&#8217;s the sort of thing better done by the likes of Shanley Kane.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that one of the things that people new to Puppet (and sometimes by extension, automated CD/CI rigs) try to do
is brickhammer their existing deployment chains into the thing. You can go look at the mailing list and about once a
week, someone will go &#8216;I need Puppet to manage this thumping great source directory which we will distribute to
$list-of-servers and then build in situ. How do I make Puppet do a <em>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install?&#8217;</em></p>

<p>To which the answer is &#8216;No.&#8217; and the answer to <em>that</em> is stropping because $reasons.</p>

<p>If you or your organisation still want to do that sort of thing, my suggestion is that you bin the terrible Unix systems
you&#8217;re using and try one of the many free (or indeed expensive) versions that come with 1990s features like a
package-management system. Mind, if you&#8217;re using Gentoo for production systems then I can&#8217;t help you. Please stop
reading there is nothing for you here.</p>

<p>Of course you can&#8217;t package up everything you might wish to bung on a server from a distance. There are also going to be
rules-lawyers hunting out corner cases in order to prove me wrong. Which, I don&#8217;t know, seems to be the broken behaviour
patterns of those who&#8217;re somehow proud of keeping some ancient and spavined code-management technique alive into the
C21st. Don&#8217;t do that either, you&#8217;re just making you own life hard. Or you&#8217;re working for an organisation ditto and why
are you doing that?</p>

<p>Our own rules are entirely arbitrary and look like this:</p>

<p>Rebuilt Debian packages and/or backports and/or wonky Ruby code that has a config file and an initscript are served as
.debs from our own repo. Building your own Debian repository is desperately simple.</p>

<p>Website code is managed through the magic of git, or the nearly-magic of svn. Not via puppet. The site furniture is
instantiated via some puppet, but deploys happen via MCollective. Sinatra-based webapps also fit here, even though
they&#8217;re wonky Ruby code with config files and initscripts. We may fix this. Or not. Who can say?</p>

<p>Tomcat apps are emitted from the end of a Jenkins-based chain and largely manage themselves. Getting Puppet involved
just seems to confuse things.</p>

<p>The new special case that prompted this ramble is a Java app that&#8217;s going to sit on some edge servers. The last thing
that happens in that Jenkins chain is that the app is packaged up as a .deb. Ok, a Java-style .deb, so the file-layout
would make a Debian packager shit themselves with hatred, but still. Since our package generation has been mostly &#8216;by
hand&#8217; up until now, I&#8217;d never bothered with hacking up the auto-upload bits of reprepro. For the Jenkins stuff to work
properly, I had to fix that. Thus when there&#8217;s a new build of the Java app, it appears moments later (depending on
cronjob) in our Debian repository.</p>

<p>At that point, I thought it would be a good thing to have the repository-uploader send a message to the event-logger so
we could see that there was a new version of code and something should probably be done about it. Not long after that, I
realised that the &#8216;something&#8217; might as well be automated, too. So actually, the repository-uploader will emit a message
to a relevant topic on our message-bus, which will trigger an &#8216;apt-get update&#8217; on the servers where that app is
installed. If we&#8217;re feeling brave and the Puppet code that manages the app has &#8216;ensure => latest&#8217; in the package
statement, then they&#8217;ll go on and install that newly updated version.</p>

<p>Which is kind of exactly the behaviour one would expect from a continuous deployment rig.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a non-technical thing that&#8217;s been wandering round my head: brogrammers are more or less exactly what you can
expect in an environment run by old-school Unix admins. Or rather, they emerged as a species in reaction to an
environment which itself was a reaction.</p>

<p>I guess I&#8217;d better unpack that and provide some material so people can go TL;DR.</p>

<h4>Brogrammers.</h4>

<p>So (i). Brogrammer. You can go look that up on the internet, because that&#8217;s what sensible people do. If they come across
a term or statement they&#8217;re not sure about, they can poke about the internet for a bit, gather information from several
sources and perhaps come to a useful conclusion. It&#8217;s not, y&#8217;know, <em>required</em>, but it&#8217;s nice when it happens and makes
them look much less like dicks than the sort of people who&#8217;ll just stand there going &#8216;No! <em>Tell</em> me what you mean!&#8217;</p>

<p>I would also ask you to go read this: <a href="http://blog.prettylittlestatemachine.com/blog/2013/02/20/what-your-culture-really-says">what your culture really says</a>, because it crystallised (or
began the process of precipitation or whatever) a lot of what this ramble may or may not be about. I have no particular
axe to grind with that piece because I am a white English bloke  in my mid forties, and if I&#8217;ve been a participant in
any of the scenarios listed I&#8217;ve not had the wit to realise it. It rings true, though. True enough that I suspect the
&#8216;if&#8217; in that preceding sentence is a &#8216;when&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I suspect this blog-thing will just contain sporadic apologies for lack of content for most of its lifetime.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>This time the excuses have been brought to you by the words &#8216;fail&#8217;, &#8216;power&#8217;, &#8216;generator&#8217;, &#8216;contactor&#8217;, &#8216;250A supply&#8217;,
&#8216;melted&#8217; and the phrases &#8216;boot that filer from a different Vol0&#8217;, &#8216;can you smell smoke?&#8217; and &#8216;Oh hell not again&#8217;.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, it&#8217;s been busy and the DR plan has been tested and found interesting.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re still Barberising and Hiera-ing up our shonky collection of Puppet modules. I&#8217;d say that they&#8217;re getting less
shonky by the day, but it&#8217;s taking longer than that. I hesitate to talk about &#8216;patterns&#8217;, because&#8230; Actually, I think
that&#8217;s an example of self-taught-hacker anti-intellectualism, which is an equal amount of rubbish as its opposite.</p>

<p>So. The Barberis(ing|ed) pattern is a fine thing and, when used in combination with the wonder that is Hiera, allows us
to do more things in simpler code.</p>

<p>However. One of the modules that I&#8217;d been putting off refactoring (so &#8216;patterns&#8217; are suspect but &#8216;refactoring&#8217; is fine,
eh?) was the one that manages our NSD install and thus the DNS for quite a number of domains, some of which contain
rather popular websites.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd/">NSD is the authoritative-only nameserver daemon written by NLNet Labs</a>, who are a top bunch of chaps. We abandoned Bind
after there were one too many vulnerability notices.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d been putting off the work because the v0.1 module just drops the entirety of the zone-files directory under
../files/ and lets Puppet do the work of synchronising the files across the nameservers. It&#8217;s not as if it&#8217;s a terrible
thing to do at first glance - Puppet&#8217;s file-serving means you can stop faffing with hand-brewed rsync scripts for
managing the out-of-band DNS data, and if you&#8217;ve got your Puppet tree in a sensible SCM, you get version control &#8216;for
free&#8217;.</p>

<p>However (again), great lumps of org-specific data like that shouldn&#8217;t really, we are told, be held within the module
tree. It&#8217;s not necessarily obvious where the data should go, though. Nor is it terribly obvious how you connect it back
to the Puppet module and have changes in the one signal the other to perform tasks.</p>

<p>Well, it is if you look at the right corners of the Internet, but this thing is mostly me groping around and trying
stuff out as a warning to others.</p>

<p>NSD installation and management goes in the now-Barberised NSD module.</p>

<p>This also deposits code that rebuilds the NSD config file when a domain is added or removed. And indeed the out-of-band
master list of domains, which semi-obviously has to travel separately from the zonefiles for $reasons.</p>

<p>(It&#8217;s about this time that someone-who-is-not-me would be going &#8216;Why isn&#8217;t all this domain gubbins in a nice database
somewhere, then all zone maintenance would be a simple &#8216;SELECT mumble FROM yinglebart WHERE tewkesbury ISNT something&#8221;,
which would be very shortly before I hauled out the sarcasm throwing machine.)</p>

<p>The zonefiles live in a git repo of their own. That repo is cloned down onto the master DNS server(s) and kept current via the
magic of post-commit hooks. Meanwhile, there&#8217;s a file resource in the NSD module which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>file { '/var/lib/nsd3/.git/HEAD':
  audit   =&gt; content,
  notify  =&gt; Exec['rebuild'],
}

exec { 'rebuild':
  command     =&gt; '/etc/nsd3/code/refresh.sh',
  refreshonly =&gt; true,
}
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; Which is lifted wholesale from
<a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/puppet-examples/tree/master/unmanaged-file-notify">here.</a> Either we&#8217;ve found one of the non-terrible use cases for this hack, or I&#8217;ll be
writing another rambling post in a few months when I&#8217;ve had a better idea.</p>
