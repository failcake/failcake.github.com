  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&#8217;s a non-technical thing that&#8217;s been wandering round my head: brogrammers are more or less exactly what you can
expect in an environment run by old-school Unix admins. Or rather, they emerged as a species in reaction to an
environment which itself was a reaction.</p>

<p>I guess I&#8217;d better unpack that and provide some material so people can go TL;DR.</p>

<h4>Brogrammers.</h4>

<p>So (i). Brogrammer. You can go look that up on the internet, because that&#8217;s what sensible people do. If they come across
a term or statement they&#8217;re not sure about, they can poke about the internet for a bit, gather information from several
sources and perhaps come to a useful conclusion. It&#8217;s not, y&#8217;know, <em>required</em>, but it&#8217;s nice when it happens and makes
them look much less like dicks than the sort of people who&#8217;ll just stand there going &#8216;No! <em>Tell</em> me what you mean!&#8217;</p>

<p>I would also ask you to go read this: <a href="http://blog.prettylittlestatemachine.com/blog/2013/02/20/what-your-culture-really-says">what your culture really says</a>, because it crystallised (or
began the process of precipitation or whatever) a lot of what this ramble may or may not be about. I have no particular
axe to grind with that piece because I am a white English bloke  in my mid forties, and if I&#8217;ve been a participant in
any of the scenarios listed I&#8217;ve not had the wit to realise it. It rings true, though. True enough that I suspect the
&#8216;if&#8217; in that preceding sentence is a &#8216;when&#8217;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I suspect this blog-thing will just contain sporadic apologies for lack of content for most of its lifetime.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>This time the excuses have been brought to you by the words &#8216;fail&#8217;, &#8216;power&#8217;, &#8216;generator&#8217;, &#8216;contactor&#8217;, &#8216;250A supply&#8217;,
&#8216;melted&#8217; and the phrases &#8216;boot that filer from a different Vol0&#8217;, &#8216;can you smell smoke?&#8217; and &#8216;Oh hell not again&#8217;.</p>

<p>As you might imagine, it&#8217;s been busy and the DR plan has been tested and found interesting.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re still Barberising and Hiera-ing up our shonky collection of Puppet modules. I&#8217;d say that they&#8217;re getting less
shonky by the day, but it&#8217;s taking longer than that. I hesitate to talk about &#8216;patterns&#8217;, because&#8230; Actually, I think
that&#8217;s an example of self-taught-hacker anti-intellectualism, which is an equal amount of rubbish as its opposite.</p>

<p>So. The Barberis(ing|ed) pattern is a fine thing and, when used in combination with the wonder that is Hiera, allows us
to do more things in simpler code.</p>

<p>However. One of the modules that I&#8217;d been putting off refactoring (so &#8216;patterns&#8217; are suspect but &#8216;refactoring&#8217; is fine,
eh?) was the one that manages our NSD install and thus the DNS for quite a number of domains, some of which contain
rather popular websites.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd/">NSD is the authoritative-only nameserver daemon written by NLNet Labs</a>, who are a top bunch of chaps. We abandoned Bind
after there were one too many vulnerability notices.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d been putting off the work because the v0.1 module just drops the entirety of the zone-files directory under
../files/ and lets Puppet do the work of synchronising the files across the nameservers. It&#8217;s not as if it&#8217;s a terrible
thing to do at first glance - Puppet&#8217;s file-serving means you can stop faffing with hand-brewed rsync scripts for
managing the out-of-band DNS data, and if you&#8217;ve got your Puppet tree in a sensible SCM, you get version control &#8216;for
free&#8217;.</p>

<p>However (again), great lumps of org-specific data like that shouldn&#8217;t really, we are told, be held within the module
tree. It&#8217;s not necessarily obvious where the data should go, though. Nor is it terribly obvious how you connect it back
to the Puppet module and have changes in the one signal the other to perform tasks.</p>

<p>Well, it is if you look at the right corners of the Internet, but this thing is mostly me groping around and trying
stuff out as a warning to others.</p>

<p>NSD installation and management goes in the now-Barberised NSD module.</p>

<p>This also deposits code that rebuilds the NSD config file when a domain is added or removed. And indeed the out-of-band
master list of domains, which semi-obviously has to travel separately from the zonefiles for $reasons.</p>

<p>(It&#8217;s about this time that someone-who-is-not-me would be going &#8216;Why isn&#8217;t all this domain gubbins in a nice database
somewhere, then all zone maintenance would be a simple &#8216;SELECT mumble FROM yinglebart WHERE tewkesbury ISNT something&#8221;,
which would be very shortly before I hauled out the sarcasm throwing machine.)</p>

<p>The zonefiles live in a git repo of their own. That repo is cloned down onto the master DNS server(s) and kept current via the
magic of post-commit hooks. Meanwhile, there&#8217;s a file resource in the NSD module which looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>file { '/var/lib/nsd3/.git/HEAD':
  audit   =&gt; content,
  notify  =&gt; Exec['rebuild'],
}

exec { 'rebuild':
  command     =&gt; '/etc/nsd3/code/refresh.sh',
  refreshonly =&gt; true,
}
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230; Which is lifted wholesale from
<a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/puppet-examples/tree/master/unmanaged-file-notify">here.</a> Either we&#8217;ve found one of the non-terrible use cases for this hack, or I&#8217;ll be
writing another rambling post in a few months when I&#8217;ve had a better idea.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I must begin by apologising for using the word &#8216;leveraged&#8217;. It&#8217;s terrible
 marketing-speak. However, it mostly fits in context and anyway I am using
 it in an ironic sense. (not that that&#8217;s even a valid excuse for the likes
 of me, but there you go.)</p>

<p>There are certain aspects of the admin trades where semi-obsessive neatness
and/or attention to detail are useful things to have. It&#8217;s one of the times
where not being able to leave the house without checking that you&#8217;ve turned the
gas off twice and locked the front door three times can be a positive thing to
admit in an interview. [NB: Self-deprecating hyperbole.]</p>

<p>It can also lead to the sort of unfortunate failure-modes that if you&#8217;re lucky
you&#8217;re not familiar with.</p>

<p>(This was all kicked off by one of the network guys asking me some hard
questions about the nature of packaging and dependencies, which set me off on a
bit of a ramble. Thus network types get it first. Beard-fondling admins get
their kicking later.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For reasons that seemed jolly sensible at the time (ie - someone dared me to do it) I gave
a much-modified version of The Puppetcamp Talk at <a href="https://www.emfcamp.org/">EMFcamp</a>. Modified in that it was four
months later and we&#8217;d made some things work better, abandoned others and had some mostly-bright
ideas for new stuff.</p>

<p>Thus linked here somewhere should be <a href="/downloads/emfcamp.pdf">the PDF version of the slides</a>, which because I am that sort of
forward-thinking sod (actually, I&#8217;d seen this be a requirement at 28c3, and it seemed sensible, so&#8230;)
was the version I presented because the Nice People didn&#8217;t have the relevent podule to connect a Macbook
to the big screen in the tent.</p>

Grand Tour season (the Giro, the Tour and now the Vuelta) which has meant that I&#8217;ve been
watching sweaty men in lycra pedal up the sides of mountains for three weeks at a time.</p>

<p>I guess I can also blame one of those periods when several mildly concerning things
happen in rapid order like a conspiring mob of buses, and when the smoke clears you&#8217;re
somewhere grim like Burnt Oak, Oldland Common or Quedgeley.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>An obvious question is &#8216;Why on earth bother with all this message-wanging gubbins? Isn&#8217;t mail and/or SSH good enough for you?&#8217; to which the glib answer is &#8216;No it isn&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

<p>A longer answer involves spotting the really obvious problem in my last post. That is &#8216;Ok, so you&#8217;ve bodged in some code that&#8217;ll auto-update your live puppetmaster tree on a commit to that repository. What are the chances that said commit is b0rked and causes an epic cake-fail?&#8217;</p>

<p>Well, in theory you&#8217;re committing to a develop branch which only one or two of your machines are following, because that&#8217;s the entire point of having the dynamic branch rig in the first place. However, PEBCAK happens and perhaps you should have a Jenkins instance that sanity-checks (as much as is possible, anyway) the puppet code that&#8217;s just been committed.</p>

<p>Hurrah! Problem solved! Let&#8217;s have one of those!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;d plumb something like that into another environment, but this is how it works here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Configure the stomp-jenkins daemon to listen for <em>puppet-environments</em> commits on <em>future.git.commits</em> (c0dez available in the usual place)</li>
<li><a href="http://vstone.eu/puppet-modules-in-jenkins/">Configure Jenkins for Puppet and puppet-lint</a></li>
<li>Configure Jenkins to emit a message on (say) <em>future.jenkins.success</em> if the tests pass. (c0dez for that available ditto)</li>
<li>Configure the stomp-git daemon on your puppetmaster to listen on <em>future.jenkins.success</em></li>
<li>Er, <em>profit.</em></li>
</ul>


<p>Obviously enough, chaining in extra bits or constructing side-chains is relentlessly trivial.</p>

<p>You could probably do it with a massive make or rake file, too.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been hacking on stomp-git over the past couple of days. Mostly because there may or may not be a lurking nasty with the way it sometimes stops listening on its, er listen topic, but
also because it has needed a deal of de-Futuring and general fettling so it doesn&#8217;t make proper coders claw their own faces off in horror.</p>

<p>And because I had forgotten how I&#8217;d made it work when it came to the svn->git rollout of one of our major sites.</p>

<p>Thus it seems as good a time as any to explain how I think it should work and indeed why it works like that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other week, I stood in front of a room filled with my notional peers and allowed as how &#8216;ActiveMQ setup was a bit of a pig, but once you&#8217;d got it working it was pretty simple.&#8217;</p>

<p>[FX: Pause for hollow laughter]</p>

<p>In retrospect, that statement was obviously going to come back and bite me just as soon as it had located its special big false teeth. Thus it came to pass on Wednesday night that two of the brokers had a meltdown, which in turn broke some experimental Nagios-over-Stomp code and so kept the poor sod who was on call in a state of near panic as <em>everything</em> reportedly failed.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>So when I pitch up on Thursday AM, I am welcomed by the whole team merrily grousing about &#8216;your effing brokers&#8217; (Some software objects are like children and pets. When they&#8217;re well behaved and/or looking cute for visitors, they&#8217;re <em>our</em> children or pets. When they&#8217;ve just left a deposit behind the telly, they&#8217;re <em>your</em> children or pets). Indeed it was a right mess. One broker had used all the memory allocated and as if for spite had run out of filehandles too. It was all a bit odd. Some poking about revealed [AMQ-jira ticket] which more-or-less explains itself and the fact that it looked an awful lot like an experimental client wasn&#8217;t responding to messages as quickly as one might hope.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the wake of Puppetcamp Edinburgh, which was jolly nice, I emitted about half a screen of rambling on one of the work IRC channels as a set of notes for future selves
(pun very much intended). This is something I do rather a lot, because <em>obviously</em> it&#8217;s impossible to perform any sort of useful thinking in an open-plan office
filled with cheery sorts who Want Things Now. The drive/ride home is also a time for sudden and Hoffman-like inspirations.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>Whatever I wrote has vanished off the end of the scrollback, so I&#8217;ll have to make it all up again.</p>
