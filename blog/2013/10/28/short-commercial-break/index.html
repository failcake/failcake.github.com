<div class="entry-content"><p><em>Trigger warning: contains talk of horrible old Unix kit running horrible old Unix</em></p>

<p>There&#8217;s a good chance I&#8217;m probably a massive arsehole and I get paid for it. Which, I dunno, maybe I&#8217;m supposed to be
pleased with myself about it because being <em>disruptive</em> is seen as a good thing these days. The last time I came across
people being described as such, they were the hyperactive (or just sugared-up) kids at junior school who seemed to be
convinced that it was all about them and if it wasn&#8217;t they&#8217;d throw a massive strop and wander round with a lower lip
hung out like a soup-plate. I&#8217;m assuming a <em>disruptive technology</em> doesn&#8217;t have a howling fit in the middle of the
organic vegetable section of the supermarket if it doesn&#8217;t get its own way, but then I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it did.</p>

<p>The thing about the arseholedom isn&#8217;t malevolent in the slightest, it&#8217;s more a case of going up to someone and asking
them why they&#8217;re nailing their legs to the table. You get this very weird selection of looks when you do things like
that. As if they&#8217;re expecting you to come up with something sarcastic about using the contact adhesive on the shelf.
Then they&#8217;ll say something like &#8216;Well we&#8217;ve <em>always</em> nailed our legs to the table in this department because it keeps
the bees from flying to Winchcombe.&#8217; Which, um, <em>okay&#8230;</em></p>

<p>I mean, there&#8217;s no answer to that. Especially when some manager piles out of the end office going &#8220;D&#8217;you want the bees
to go to Winchcombe? Do you? Because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen if you don&#8217;t buck your ideas up and crack on with
that hammering.&#8221;</p>

<p>But you have to try. You point to one of the chairs in the corner and suggest that using those would be much less
unpleasant. That&#8217;s when the trouble <em>really</em> starts. The manager goes pop-eyed and kicks off about &#8216;You smart buggers in
IT think you know everything coming down here with your <em>ideas</em> I don&#8217;t have time for <em>ideas</em> there&#8217;s barely enough time
to send Bob here down to the hardware shop for more nails, what with the bleeding and the Tetanus jabs and now you want
us to cross-train to <em>chairs</em> I&#8217;m glad you think we all sit around with glue-guns like you wasters someone should sort
you lot out once and for all.&#8217;</p>

<p>So you pull a chair over and they look at you like you just shat out a railway station.</p>

<p>What this is really about is that years ago (HP-UX 10.20 ago, in fact) I was given a HP9000 to look after. In poking
around the filesystem to see what dreadful sort of albatross I&#8217;d been handed, I found a whole pile of cron-jobs that ran
scripts to monitor sendmail and some more scripts that re-started sendmail and further scripts that tested the state of
earlier scripts. It all seemed a bit pointless because even then sendmail could more or less be left alone to generate
remote root exploits and sometimes deliver mail.</p>

<p>I asked one of the longer-serving chaps and he came over all leg-nailing. Apparently it wasn&#8217;t to be touched because
sendmail was dreadfully unreliable and crashed every half hour.</p>

<p>I nodded, smiled and went off to throw away all the junk and upgrade the sendmail install to $latest.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t crash.</p>

<p>The point being that writing long-lived daemon processes is really very well known science and instead of mucking about
with multiple layers of monitoring and backup, you&#8217;re much better off making the daemon work right.</p>
