<div class="entry-content"><p>It seems that one of the things that people new to Puppet (and sometimes by extension, automated CD/CI rigs) try to do
is brickhammer their existing deployment chains into the thing. You can go look at the mailing list and about once a
week, someone will go &#8216;I need Puppet to manage this thumping great source directory which we will distribute to
$list-of-servers and then build in situ. How do I make Puppet do a <em>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install?&#8217;</em></p>

<p>To which the answer is &#8216;No.&#8217; and the answer to <em>that</em> is stropping because $reasons.</p>

<p>If you or your organisation still want to do that sort of thing, my suggestion is that you bin the terrible Unix systems
you&#8217;re using and try one of the many free (or indeed expensive) versions that come with 1990s features like a
package-management system. Mind, if you&#8217;re using Gentoo for production systems then I can&#8217;t help you. Please stop
reading there is nothing for you here.</p>

<p>Of course you can&#8217;t package up everything you might wish to bung on a server from a distance. There are also going to be
rules-lawyers hunting out corner cases in order to prove me wrong. Which, I don&#8217;t know, seems to be the broken behaviour
patterns of those who&#8217;re somehow proud of keeping some ancient and spavined code-management technique alive into the
C21st. Don&#8217;t do that either, you&#8217;re just making you own life hard. Or you&#8217;re working for an organisation ditto and why
are you doing that?</p>

<p>Our own rules are entirely arbitrary and look like this:</p>

<p>Rebuilt Debian packages and/or backports and/or wonky Ruby code that has a config file and an initscript are served as
.debs from our own repo. Building your own Debian repository is desperately simple.</p>

<p>Website code is managed through the magic of git, or the nearly-magic of svn. Not via puppet. The site furniture is
instantiated via some puppet, but deploys happen via MCollective. Sinatra-based webapps also fit here, even though
they&#8217;re wonky Ruby code with config files and initscripts. We may fix this. Or not. Who can say?</p>

<p>Tomcat apps are emitted from the end of a Jenkins-based chain and largely manage themselves. Getting Puppet involved
just seems to confuse things.</p>

<p>The new special case that prompted this ramble is a Java app that&#8217;s going to sit on some edge servers. The last thing
that happens in that Jenkins chain is that the app is packaged up as a .deb. Ok, a Java-style .deb, so the file-layout
would make a Debian packager shit themselves with hatred, but still. Since our package generation has been mostly &#8216;by
hand&#8217; up until now, I&#8217;d never bothered with hacking up the auto-upload bits of reprepro. For the Jenkins stuff to work
properly, I had to fix that. Thus when there&#8217;s a new build of the Java app, it appears moments later (depending on
cronjob) in our Debian repository.</p>

<p>At that point, I thought it would be a good thing to have the repository-uploader send a message to the event-logger so
we could see that there was a new version of code and something should probably be done about it. Not long after that, I
realised that the &#8216;something&#8217; might as well be automated, too. So actually, the repository-uploader will emit a message
to a relevant topic on our message-bus, which will trigger an &#8216;apt-get update&#8217; on the servers where that app is
installed. If we&#8217;re feeling brave and the Puppet code that manages the app has &#8216;ensure => latest&#8217; in the package
statement, then they&#8217;ll go on and install that newly updated version.</p>

<p>Which is kind of exactly the behaviour one would expect from a continuous deployment rig.</p>
