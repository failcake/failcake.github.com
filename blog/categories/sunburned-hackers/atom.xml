    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For reasons that seemed jolly sensible at the time (ie - someone dared me to do it) I gave
a much-modified version of The Puppetcamp Talk at <a href="https://www.emfcamp.org/">EMFcamp</a>. Modified in that it was four
months later and we'd made some things work better, abandoned others and had some mostly-bright
ideas for new stuff.</p>

<p>Thus linked here somewhere should be <a href="/downloads/emfcamp.pdf">the PDF version of the slides</a>, which because I am that sort of
forward-thinking sod (actually, I'd seen this be a requirement at 28c3, and it seemed sensible, so...)
was the version I presented because the Nice People didn't have the relevent podule to connect a Macbook
to the big screen in the tent.</p>
