<div class="entry-content"><p>I am incompetent and I can&#8217;t make Vagrant work.</p>

<p>At least, that&#8217;s the excuse I&#8217;ve been making for not joining in with the
rest of the floor in using that for Puppet (among other things) development. Instead, my dev-rig is a VM running as a
puppetmaster that&#8217;s tracking the changes I make to a given branch in our Git repo via the magic of post-commit hooks and
another VM in which I can run &#8216;puppet agent &#8211;debug &#8211;blah &#8211;server (first VM)&#8217;. Once in a while I remember to blow away
the second VM so I can make sure everything builds in the right order. However, even with snapshots it&#8217;s just slightly
too painful to happen regularly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, quite a lot of the recent developments at Future have involved rigs of between eight and twelve boxes.
Generating a worthwhile test/dev version of one of those is rather tiresome because even if you&#8217;ve got the spare
horsepower lying about, you have to spend yea-long wiring it all together, sanitising the static and/or test data and
it all quickly gets completely <em>oh god why did i even get out of bed i should have been a farmer like my dad mind you if
i had done that i&#8217;d have been out of bed at six to go feed the sheep on long barrow bank perhaps not after all&#8230;</em></p>

<p>So when a mildly broken Dell R620 arrived back from one of the DCs coincidentally with me wanting to have a play with
this Docker business, it all seemed a bit convenient.</p>

<p>I am incompetent and I can&#8217;t make Docker work. On Debian.</p>

<p><a href="http://linuxcontainers.org/">LXC</a>, on the other hand, was slightly simpler than falling off a log.</p>

<p>Given that it&#8217;s simple to build a puppetmaster that&#8217;s the same as one of the live ones, and that all the machine config
I currently care about is in a manifest, it should be pretty easy to generate a container and have it puppet itself up
tolerably quickly.</p>

<p>This indeed turned out to be the case. However, having to hand-allocate IP addresses and fiddle about with container
naming such that they picked up the configs in use on the live rig was all a bit too hands-on and really not what I
wanted.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">DNSMasq</a> fixed the first problem. It is a surprisingly useful tool.</p>

<p>A rakefile which read a list of made-up machine names, generated softlinks to the actual hiera node configs and then
instantiated the relevant containers fixed the second.</p>

<p>I also spent <em>quite some time</em> building a Wheezy &#8216;image&#8217; that minimised apt-get as much as possible.</p>

<p>Result - fully puppeted containers come up in circa a minute. Somewhat longer if you have to install PHP.
If I didn&#8217;t have quite such a rational hatred of golden images and all who sail in them, it would likely be faster
still.</p>

<p>The next part is a bit fiddly.</p>

<p>The example problem I now have is that some parts of my collection of yea-many VMs want to connect to other parts. For
instance if I have a redis slave, I need to know what the master&#8217;s IP address might be during the puppet run. At Future,
we generate a location fact and use that in our hiera, er, hierarchy to configure things like message brokers,
smarthosts and DNS ordering. I could just add yet another location - testbox, or something - allocate a block of IP
space and then add some extra indirection. And then I could do that again for each person and/or project that wanted to
run up a test-rig. At which point one has just run into a behaviour pattern that should probably be named &#8216;It&#8217;s OK, I
can fix that for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>I first came across this in, er, 1991 when doing some NHS-related coding. One of the other chaps had written a thing
which had to deal with, oh I don&#8217;t know, ten items or something. Because he was a forward-thinking sort, he allocated
sixteen slots in his array and beetled off all smug for a coffee and a corned beef sandwich. As you might expect, a few
months later one site or other had a list of seventeen items and a bug report. &#8216;It&#8217;s OK, I can fix that for you!&#8217; went
our chap and expanded the array to the clearly ludicrous value of some twenty-three slots&#8230;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s scope for an Eric Berne knockoff book of tiresome technical behaviour antipatterns, isn&#8217;t there?</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m using DHCP, and I wanted the entire edifice to work with little or no extra typing.</p>

<p>CoreOS&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">ETCD</a> looked like a good fit. Emit salient facts to etcd database when bringing up (say) redis master, then
query same via <a href="https://github.com/garethr/hiera-etcd">Garethr&#8217;s hiera-etcd</a> when bringing up the slave. Profit!</p>

<p>That bit did take a little tinkering to get right.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the notion of a reactive puppet configuration is really rather interesting. Other people may well be
screaming in terror and jabbering about things like &#8216;deadly embrace&#8217; and &#8216;terrible feedback loops are fine for the Jesus
and Mary Chain (Or A Place to Bury Strangers if that&#8217;s too retro for you) but have no place in a theoretically stable
configuration.&#8217; However, just as a top-down decision process enforced by rigid hierarchy is a hateful idea for a
workplace environment, so it is for a machine environment.</p>

<p>TL;DR - code in <a href="https://github.com/FuturePublishing/model-village">Github</a>, patches welcome.</p>
